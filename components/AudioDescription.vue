        To reach a higher level of Transparency we have developed a movement sequence as a duet, which enables people to become invisible in front of the eyes of the tracking systems. A knotting of two bodies (in one place, together). The extremities are intertwined in such a way that the computer can no longer assign them to two people.

        In the later part of the Audio Guide, among other things, the perspective of the tracking system is taken and the feelings of a confused artificial intelligence are made comprehensible. It can be emphatically felt how frustrating it can be to have to constantly recognize a movement that is becoming more and more transparent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just like when the recognition system tries to follow the movement and the bodies slowly become transparent to the eye, the installation imitates this process and in the thoughts of the listener, the described overall movement of both bodies (described in a whole) becomes transparent to him.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this purpose, we have interlocked the instructions/descriptions that make up the movement sequence for the node. Both instructions lose their references to the persons executing them. The listener is no longer able to differentiate between the two persons and thus cannot comprehend the movement in his imagination, it has become transparent.
      </p>

        While today learning "transparent" movements is apparently of a hypothetical nature, according to the point of Vitreous Body it is an absolute necessity. That is why this audio guide explains the basics and necessity of becoming absolutely transparent.
